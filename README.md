# python-exercises
Self-made python exercises for improving knowledge about logic and syntax.

Since I am a beginner at python, and because it's very useful in Data Science and many other heavy mathematics projects,
I made this little "course" with useful features that I'd probably use to develop real software.

Therefore, this repository is a collection of various exercises, organised with introductions,
restrictions in variables and examples of inputs and outputs, alongside with their respective resolutions

It is simple but also import since it's my second contact with python, i think it is good to share it here to maintain it saved since i lost my previous projects.
